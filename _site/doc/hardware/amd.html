<p>The specifications for Amino boards are provided via a reference opensource implementation. Anyone is free to take this reference design and replicate or remix it according to the opensource license applied to it. We will list such boards here in addition to the reference boards. In order to be Amino compliant we will setup certain requirements and tests TBD.</p>
