<ol>
<li><em>Modularisation</em> - A modular topology enables common components to be snapped together using composition, allowing focus on just the custom features of a given project or task, it also reduces complexity and leads to faster project turnaround.</li>

<li><em>Standardisation</em> - In order to have modulisation and composition as well as reuse, standardisation is required via opensoource implementations made available for testing, production, modification and experimentation.</li>

<li><em>Digitisation</em> - Opensource software is perfectly digital it’s reproduction is as simply as copying bits, hardware isn’t so simple, but the more of it that can be digitally expressed and rendered the easier its reproduction and the more accessible it becomes to a larger audience.</li>

<li><em>Reuse</em> - Being able to reuse as much hardware and software as possible reduces consumption and is more environmentally friendly. Common modules or components can be assembled at reduced cost minimising overlap, they can be reused time and time again for experimentation and prototyping. Hacking culture often seeks to reuse, mashup and redefine items for use elsewhere, design should embrace this modern form of cultural reuse.</li>
